# Expansion Dance

![Orders](/assets/images/pelagia_11001.jpg)

I'm moving my armies into position to grab that chokepoint in the south and an army to take that last space in the north. Another expansion army is going to clear out that northwest corner and I get some of those green independents ready to take that last chokepoint space. R'Lyeh is moving on my island which I'm not super happy about.
