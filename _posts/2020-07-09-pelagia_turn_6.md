# Blasting Through

![Orders](/assets/images/pelagia_06001.jpg)

My first contact with EA R'Lyeh in the East. I'm going to want to take that bottleneck so that he can't push through there. My armies converge on that province hnorth of my holdings and I prepare a second expedition to head west into that small inland sea.
