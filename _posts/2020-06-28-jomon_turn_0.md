# Pretender Design and Thoughts

![Dragon God](/assets/images/jomon_00000.jpg)

I'm going with a dragon chassis on this one because it seems fun. I did a little single player testing with this pretender before the game started and it seems like he's a pretty good thug that can dive at the back line and tear them up while the main body of independent armies is scrambling to chase him around. I'm going with an air bless so that I can use air shield to hopefully keep the bulk of arrows off my squishy sacred troops even though I'm sure I'll continue to have problems with ranged attackers. I didn't do this in testing but it might be a good idea to have some units of cavalry ready to scramble around the periphery of battles to jump in and attack anyone shooting into my combats.

Reading up it seems like Jomon has a lot of problems. No shields, medium casters, so this could be a tough fight. Their shark dudes seem really cool though so my plan is to beeline it underwater as fast as I can so that I can start throwing armies of shark guys at my enemies.
