# Getting Back on Track

![Overview](/assets/images/ulm_08001.jpg)

My army is moving north, hopefully without coming into conflict with the other player expanding up there. I'm recruiting forces for a second army to head south and try to take that province with all the heavy cav. Ulm seems slow but powerful. I'm almost to the level of evocation I need to get to in order to start throwing iron storms down on the heads of my enemies and it seems like everything will probably go a little bit smoother once that happens.
