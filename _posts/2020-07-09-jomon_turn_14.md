# First Blood

![Monkey Fight](/assets/images/jomon_14001.jpg)

A single monkey attacks my province and gets butchered by the local defensive forces.

We take the local province with the small expeditionary force I sent without too many losses. We've almost pushed Utgard out of the area surrounding our lands and now have a direct path to the throne province.

We face our first real challenge here and our blades taste giant blood. A good sized force of giants versus our small expeditionary army clash in a province in his cap circle. I lose almost the entirely of my melee forces, with my giant sharks proving less giant than their giant giants and the sohei's blades unable to kill them fast enough to save their own lives. However, in terms of sheer numbers, we manage to kill as many of them as they do of us, with each of our kills counting for more, in my mind, since he's losing giants and I lose only men. The Tengu takes a chest wound in the fight that he'll carry with him forever.

Faithless centaurs overthrow my rule and take the forest for themselves. With my armies on the other side of the lake they'll keep it for now.

I move my main army into position in case Utgard tries to push back at me while Snakebite moves up to reinforce with more sharks. I finally have a water breathing monk to send to build a temple in the lake so soon I'll have the Ryujin I need to really get this war train rolling. Tien Chi is taking territory in my cap circle but says he'll give it back - we'll see. I actually change this order after screenshotting and leave my forces in place in the northernmost province in case he tries to attack. They may not be able to absorb a full assault, but I think it's important to keep it just in case Caelum tries to grab the province once it's Utgard colored again. Allies are nice but I can't afford to gain less territory than him in this war since he, too, will eventually be my foe.
