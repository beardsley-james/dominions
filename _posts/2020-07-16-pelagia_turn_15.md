# Reinforcing

![Orders](/assets/images/pelagia_15001.jpg)

My reinforcements are moving in. It'll take them a couple turns to get there but when they do there should be a nice cozy fort waiting for them. I move my prophet to head into R'Lyeh lands and start preaching the word there. I'm building a turtle tribe army in my fort so I can start taking land provinces for fun. Probably that farm in the west now that I'm looking - it's right next to a throne, which is nice, and those spaces have high income too. Agartha might not like me poking my head out of the water but that's good if it makes them move their forces. I plan on fighting Agartha right away when my forces are in position so it's only a few turns away. Very exciting. That western pond is a busy place.
