# A New Enemy

My poor barbarians take the brunt of the heavy cavalry assault with some mercenary losses as well, but we manage to rout them otherwise and take the territory.

Unfortunately it looks like some purple eagle guy has set up camp in territory that I decided was mine. They've left it undefended so I move in anyway. This is my town. A reinforcement army starts moving north and I decide to spy on the Agarthan capital. My fort is getting built up there, too, though it looks like I'll need another fort in the east if I'm going to make friends on that side of my empire.
