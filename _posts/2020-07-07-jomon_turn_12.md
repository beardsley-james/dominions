# Moving Into Position

What does this mean? I'm not near anyone that uses satyrs, I don't think. Maybe an independent spy? Who know.

What does this mean? Is this an offensive spell of some sort or is it just something that happens? My poor guys get all sick. This is the province I took because I thought Utgard was building a fort here, the start of all my woes, but it's not under immediate threat now so I leave it alone. Might build a fort here soon though.

This is my eastern army, sohei with archer support and some tough sharks. Should be enough to take like 20 giants I hope but more than that and I might be in trouble. Tien Chi tell me Caelum has started its assault.

My spies take their provinces without a hitch. Suddenly I'm on Utgard's doorstep and he doesn't have as much income anymore. I move my spies to attack further provinces in case he doesn't remember to boost PD and set my ninja to sneaking again. I'm reinforcing the eastern army and recruiting a commander for the western army before I start moving north to take territory. Snakebite patrols his province and research in evocation 2 is complete so I start researching summoning so I can get Tanuki because that would make my wife happy. I'm worried about Phlegra - I sent him a message but he never replied. Is he intending to wage war on me?
