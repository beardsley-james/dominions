# Defeat of Utgard

![Animal Fight](/assets/images/jomon_16001.jpg)

I'm moving into position to take my cap circle now. This is the first blood for my animal squad, which proves very successful in rushing forward and being ridiculous. I don't think I'll waste a ton of gems summoning animals but they're a pretty good time.

One of my ninjas is caught in the province holding the bulk of Utgard's forces but at least I get to see whate they're working with. Lots of giants is the answer, big blobs of them, and I don't like the idea of facing this many of the big guys in battle. They don't move on me, though, and Caelum is sieging their cap. They go AI after this without telling anyone which is, apparently, considered a dick move.

With my underwater temple online I start recruiting the first, but not last, of my dragon mages who will hopefully be able to reap some souls for the dragon king once he gets on a battlefield. They take two turns to summon and getting another one online soon is a pretty high priority for me. There are two open underwater provinces available in the vicinity, but one of them is half filled by Abysia who I am not going to war against at the moment.

I send a small squad north to take that province that Utgard is barely holding onto and the rest of my forces west to join up with the bulk of my army in case of an Utgard assault. I send the priest that built the temple west to spread my dominion to that space which is unfortunately not currently worshipping Snakebite the way I went them to and move to take the last space in my cap circle. My spies fan out to keep an eye on things and I build a shugenja to boost my research in Joton proper.
