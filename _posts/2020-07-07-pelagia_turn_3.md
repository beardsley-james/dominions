Pelagian troops don't seem very good. They win, but it's against Ichtyids so I hope so, and they take significant losses, to the tune of 20%. A guide I read online says that their shark clan guys are actually better because they get to attack three times a turn so I'm going to start massing them instead of these soldier units and hopefully that works better.

I'm going to move my scouts out to check out the other territories in my domain and use my existing army to patrol for now. A bigger army is going to start handling expansion since I don't see any real good targets for my small army at this point, they'll probably move in and build a fort in a couple turns after the new expansion army gets a chance to move south, and then a second expansion army to clear my cap circle.
