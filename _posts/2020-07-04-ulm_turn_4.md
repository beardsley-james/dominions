Facing three times their number, the brave soldiers of Ulm charge towards their enemies and strike them down in devastating numbers. The brave lion warriors try their best to stem the iron tide but can only stand so long before they flee the battle.

I prepare reinforcements for them after the next battle, but in the meantime a commander ferries over fresh troops.

Both small armies prepare to meet the enemy in the western province, a small force of wolf tribe warriors defending their ancestral hunting grounds. Afterwards, if enough soldiers survive, they'll travel north to fight the beastmen in the wasteland beyond while the secondary commander travels back to the capital to deliver his own army to heathens to the south. There's no sign of the lion snake that terrorized the borders last turn, though I suspect he's traveled northwest towards those farmlands.

This creature lurks in the shadows of Phlegra's territory, a brutal looking creature with a spear the length of two men, an army in his own right. He's several spaces away now but he still remains a lurking menace on the horizon. I'll have to reach out to Phlegra to see if we can't draw up some borders.
