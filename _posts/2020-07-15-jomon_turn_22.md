# Cleaning Up Phlegra

![Announcements](/assets/images/jomon_22001.jpg)

Phlegra is taken by Caelum, and surrounding regions as well. I clear the sieging forces from my lake and get back to making Ryujin and shark warriors. I get to watch a couple battles, too, but don't learn anything in particular. I've made contact with Atlantis, who appears to be gobbling up Phlegran territory from the east, having moved through Marignon which is still hanging in there. Abysia took my throne so they're on the list now.

I'm moving my forces into the province I lost to barbarians. My Ryujin is coming back for more action and I've got another reinforcement stack showing up too. It looks like Phlegra retook a province from Caelum last turn, so they aren't totally out of the game, but it's not big enough to challenge either of my armies currently. Caelum is in my southern flank, now, but seems to mostly be raiding Tien Chi provinces and not really holding anything. Tien Chi reports he's trying to catch their armies with his own forces because he thinks he can beat them in a stand up fight. I need to start preaching in Phlegran territories so I can tip the scales my way.
