# Tide of Iron

![Battle in the Forbidden Forest](/assets/images/ulm_06001.jpg)

I honestly expected to lose more troops to the barbarians in this province but it seems the might of Ulmish infantry proves itself again. Few losses, and another province in my cap circle.

My current army is going to head west to meet the militia men in the farm there while a new army heads east to take the province there. Hopefully Phlegra doesn't step into it, though, or I'll have my first player conflict this game. After that, I think I'll have to start moving an army north because it seems like that's the only open direction currently.
