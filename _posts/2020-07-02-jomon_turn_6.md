The samurai archers are doing a lot better now that they are actually firing their bows instead of just hitting people with them. They clear out this indy province with hardly a loss but it seems like they're in for a tougher fight soon.

The ultgard incursion to the north has me worried. It looks like their commander is stationary, which mean he might be building a fort. The last thing I need is a giant fort a stone's throw away from my border. I waver for a moment on what to do but I decide to strike them now before they have a chance to dig in. I saw their battle last turn and it seems like they had a hard time dealing with those heavy cav so I know they aren't at 100% and may not be expecting an immediate attack.

I'm recruiting a better commander who'll be able to form up solid lines. It slows down my shugenja recruitment but it's better to take care of the present threat presently. I'm recruiting more sacred troops and archers to try to hold the line against the giant menace.

The plan is for my main force to move into the cap and pick up reinforcements, and then move into a striking position to attack the ultgard army before they can finish the fort. Next turn I'm going to recruit another horse commander and some cavalry to move in as support because I think they can move two provinces in a turn. My ninja is going to lurk around to keep an eye out for enemy movement in case they start bringing up reinforcements. I really need another ninja but that has to hold until this battle is finished. If I hear from the giant player before I strike I might not but he didn't respond when I messaged him on the discord channel so I don't know if diplomacy is a real option. Snakebite is going to stay on fort building duty licking his wounds. I don't know what's going on south or west or east of me, which has me worried, but I don't think it's a good idea to let this guy sit on my borders unharassed.
