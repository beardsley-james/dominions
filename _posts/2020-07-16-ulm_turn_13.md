The Pythium army puts up a stiff resistance - they move an army I didn't see into position to defend the province and pump up the province defensive forces, but it's not enough to prevent me from routing them. They manage to almost totally decimate my mercenary companies, hilariously barely touching my main force. Black plate infantry kill a lot of guys and so do the crossbowmen, though the priest smith doesn't do as much samage as I was expecting.

Unexpected as this opposition was, I take advantage of his heavy losses and prepare to snatch another province from him, though in retrospect I should probably leave someone behind to fort up the province I just took. My northern expansion armies are almost ready to start operations with reinforcements moving in. I've only got nine provinces in turn twelve which is well under where I should be so I'll have to make up for it with some ass kicking. Agartha looks like they're building up a tough army so I'll have to kick them around too. I start a reinforcement army moving east to back up the forces there and bolster my offensive against Pythia.
