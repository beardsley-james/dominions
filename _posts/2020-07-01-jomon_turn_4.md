# Berserker Samurai Archers I guess

In my practice games these archers are pretty great but in this one they keep charging forward and trying to beat people to death with their bows which, to be fair, seems to work exceptionally well but I really feel like they'd be more effective shooting. It's not until next turn I realize I have them programmed to attack enemy archers instead of fire at enemy archers so good job samurai archers at being successful in spite of my commands.

Like seriously I don't know if they strapped razor blades to their bows or what but good job archers.

In the province that my poor cripple dragon re-attacks, he just wins outright because I guess he managed to kill their leaders before they brought him low last turn. Well done, Snakebite, but your job isn't over yet.

My dominion spread out a little bit so now I can see that this lake on the other side seems to be much softer than the bigger lake, with mermen instead of tritons, so I think it makes more sense to strike out over there instead of taking the larger lake. I can always come back and build another fort.

![Nice find](/assets/images/jomon_04007.jpg)

Snakebite managed to find a lava lake in the province he had to hit twice and now I'm just a few turns of research and a water shugenja from getting the ring I need to be able to build a temple and start summoning dragon wizards.

![Troop movement](/assets/images/jomon_04008.jpg)

I'm moving Snakebite to take the lake and my other forces are moving southeast to take out those icthyids. I read up on their stats and I think that's the softest target and it's in my cap circle so I can move my holy caster into combat with them so he can get some extra blesses on the field, as well as his little bodyguard of sacred troops.

![Recruitment](/assets/images/jomon_04009.jpg)

I'm going to keep recruiting master shugenja until I need someone else more or I get a water one that can build me some scuba gear. I like the spear wielding holy troops, especially since I can get them in close, and some archers aren't bad either. This is probably going to be my recruitment queue for awhile.
