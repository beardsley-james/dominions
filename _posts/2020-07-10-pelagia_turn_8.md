# An Enemy to the South

My swollen ranks make quick work of these weird fish monsters and my cap circle is complete.

It looks like LA R'Lyeh has been working hard in the south. That's his pretender on my border so I pump some province defense there in case he attacks. I send a small army south to pick up reinforcements and consolidate my borders and send my western army south to threaten there. I'm going to try to take that chokepoint with a perhaps too small force but if I take it I'm going to build a fort there and plan on taking that throne in a few turns. There's no one that I can see in that inland lake so I can take it with little risk, I think. I may get into my first oceanic war soon but I should be able to start popping out water elementals soon. I made a big spellcaster in my cap and he'll be summoning plenty of them. My dominion continues to spread.
