# Moving East

![Skirmish](/assets/images/jomon_17001.jpg)

My forces make quick work of the Utgard defenses and take the territory. I agree to return it to Caelum and move that army south to wait for an army to build up to the take the throne province nearby.

At some point Snakebite picked up a disease and he's slowly wasting away. I don't have a ton of options for dealing with this right now so I move him to the capital and start focusing my research on getting enough power to craft a ring of regeneration, which won't totally cure him but will at least keep him from dying, though he'll continue to pick up afflictions until such a time as I find some way to cure them.

Good thing he's moving back, too, since some cult has taken hold there and he'll need to help restore the faith.

My prophet finds some good magic sites in Doven, and we'll be able to use the gem income once I can get back to summoning.

Caelum is asking about my borders with Tien-Chi, which I don't like since TC has been a good ally so far. I sent him a warning and suggested that we back each other up in case of an attack from Caelum - it's going to be blood between me and the bird people at some point, and I'd rather the blood be theirs. Caelum, for now, is going to assist me in invading Phlegra. He also says he's going to finish off the giants' armies so I move my forces south to prepare to assault Phlegra. Phlegra has been taken over by a new player. I offered to sign an NAP with him if he gave me Death Marsh in the south, but he declined so I'll be taking it by force.

I am moving my cap-circle army to take the land to the south and I'm building a new army in Joton which will be meeting up with the shark forces and the Ryujin to take Death Marsh. My main army is heading south to get into position to assault the other Phlegra province. Hopefully attacking three province at the same time puts me in a good position to really push my claim there. I know Phlegra is at war with Marignon, which I assume is to their south, so hopefully he's busy with other things. My spies are moving towards that border and I'm going to recruit some ninja to equip with enchanted items to try to assassinate some leaders and take some easy wins. Tien-Chi tells me that Abysia and Agartha at war so my western flank should be fairly secure while I build up forces there and prepare to vulture the conflict given the option.

I feel like my position is much better now than it was a few turns ago, this war with Utgard turned out to be a pretty good idea. I have fourteen provinces instead of six and secure borders for the most part in three directions. I haven't taken significant losses in my conflicts against the giants and I'm constructing my third fort with considerable reinforcements coming into play. I don't know much about Phlegran forces at the moment but I'm sure I'll learn quick and if I strike fast and hard he'll have to abandon the conflict with Marignon. It is a new commander, though, and more diplomatically active than the one previous so I'm worried that Caelum is secretly working with him and will strike me once I'm committed, which is why I'm trying to negotiate a mutual defense pact with Tien-Chi. Also because Caelum has a Pepe avatar on Discord.

## Stay tuned.
