# Disappearing Giants

He smartens up and puts some PD into his provinces. None of the scouts have the combat skills to stand up to them so they all die RIP. That's fine though. He doesn't take any of his provinces back and Caelum took the one to the east of his cap.

This is my western army, with samurai cavalry to hit the leader and a good chunk of sohei to hit the front. I set my shugenja to spam attack spells because I want to take out a good chunk of his HP before they hit my front lines if possible and a couple independent commanders with their crap soldiers are set in front to take enemy javelin fire. Saniiro is there mostly to bless my sohei and keep them from getting hit by javelins.

I move my secondary army in the west to retake that territory and move the main army up. I don't know where the twenty giants in that province went, though. I check the database and they aren't supposed to have any stealth in that army so I really have no idea. The plan is to push north with both of the armies and take territory there and I start building a small expansion army in my cap so I can finally get that last province in my cap circle. I need to make sure I'm fighting with my armies because they are costing me a lot of army. Should be a small battle in the east this turn and maybe one next turn but I was expecting to fight giants sooner than is happening. Oh well, good chance to see if my spell scripting is going to work out.
