These two items show up in events. Hurray! I put them on some units and send them out with armies to bolster my forces elsewhere.

My armies are still en route and picking up reinforcements to head into their respective theaters and my fortresses are under construction. I should get another in that southeast corner. I have a giant stack of turtle warriors getting ready to go, too, so that they can take some land provinces, probably not many though because turtle warriors aren't very good and shark tritons are where it's at.
