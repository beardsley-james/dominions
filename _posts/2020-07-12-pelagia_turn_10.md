# Not Snake Stomping

![Scary Snake](/assets/images/pelagia_10001.jpg)

This is the god of MA R'Lyeh, a pretty tough looking customer. Poison attacks, lots of hit points, high attack skill, high protection, fear, awe, all the good stuff. Wonder if he tanked scaled to get this guy awake. He already took an affliction, though, and I think my snake tribe tritons might be able to berserk into not running away as long as I can keep the commander from routing.

I'm moving my spies around and reinforcing the army in the northeast. I'm going to try to take that chokepoint and build a fort there and also take that throne. I'm moving forces to the south, as well, to try to take the chokepoint there and get ready to go for a second throne. Looks like there's some activity in that pond but it's just land-based nations and I'll need to push them out of my seas and teach them to fear Papa Smurf.
