# Opening Moves

This is Kyle Gass, the prophet of Jack Black, he will smite enemies with his hammer and also rock out.

I'm going to get some flail dudes and some dogs to go on adventures with him and also a priest to start smiting enemies and a smith to build some cool ass gear. It's going to be great.

It's going to be great later, when I'm ready to kick ass. For now it's going to be boring and my spy is going to go find some people to harass.
