# Over the Edge

Some sort of nudist nonsense in the woods makes my people believe in me less. I'm not sure how you're supposed to sing and dance in the wood but naked seems fine. Apparently the book of Snakebite disagrees.

I prepare my armies to move against Utgard. My ninja doesn't report any troop movement on his side of the disputed territory so I'm expecting to face his three giants and some points of PD, though I don't know if he's expecting a full scale attack. He's in my dominion so I don't know how much information he has about troop movements on my side of the board. Some merpeople take a break from the construction of Snakebite's palace under the sea to join in the fray, though fish people are hardly full citizens of the Emperor's dominion and they'll have to prove their honor by catching the brunt of whatever slings the barbarous giants bring to bear on us. Most of the infantry is arrayed in lines, ready to charge ahead with the blessing of their god to clash with the invaders. A lone horseman travels from the capital, bearing a burning blade and a blacksteel helmet to strike against whatever creature commands their fell forces.

My northern ninja travels further northward, hopefully to find who borders Utgard's other frontier and seek their aid in the coming war. The other travels south to see what dangers await us there. Snakebite continues to construct the dragon fortress while the Icthyids levy troops to continue expansion east. On the eve of battle the armies sing hymns to Snakebite and sharpen their blades to face the beasts lurking in the fields of wheat beyond. Destruction and blood stain the morrow but tonight they rest.

I did contact Utgard's commander and notify him that I would prefer that he not settle a fort in that space, but as he has not vacated the territory I can only assume that we are now at war. My intention is to secure my border; if he calls for a truce after that I'll consider it strongly but I'm not counting out a further push into his territory if I seem to have the upper hand.
