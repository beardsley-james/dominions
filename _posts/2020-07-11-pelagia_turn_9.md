# Maybe Snake Stomping

I lost my expansion army in the east and I'm getting another one ready to go up there and finish that province off so I can build a fort there. My central expansion army moves south. They might bump with LA R'Lyeh's pretender, hopefully in a battle that I win, but who knows. He looks like a beast. Someone's in my lake towards the east but it looks like a land army that's moved underwater and there's the throne between me and them so I have some room to maneuver there before he'll be able to take me on. I may try to take the island bordering both the R'Lyehs and set up a fort there. I feel like I'm in a pretty good position here and I have a lot of territory claimed, even if I haven't totally taken it yet. I have ten provinces and am on target to take 13 by turn 12 which would be pretty good.
