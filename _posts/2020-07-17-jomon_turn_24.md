# Holding Pattern

With Construction 4 researched and a ring of regeneration being made, I send my shugenja into the wilderness to seek magic gems, my income of such being somewhat lacking. Snakebite is researching so he'll be able to tput that on next turn. I'm sending an army north, theoretically to build another shugenja fort but also just in case I decide to attack Abysia next turn. My armies in the south are sieging Phlegran cities, though the capital itself seems unlikely to crack soon. with a bit of a lull on my hands, I'm making plans. I'm probably going to start constructing items with some level of earnestness next turn so that I can equip some sort of thug chassis to go raiding with. I need to research conjuration so I can chain summon up to someone that can craft a potion of cure-all, though I'll need a considerable increase in the number of nature gems I'm using to do that anyway. I can summon a lot of fire ants without touching my nature gem income but I don't see a need to do so. with the amount of money I have coming in I can do a lot of interesting things, really. I could spread south into that other pond, for example, so that I can start building another lab/fort/temple space and make more Ryujin, I could also spread into the pond in the east since Abysia hasn't claimed the whole place yet for some reason. That actually might be a good idea, I have enough sharks in the pond to do so pretty easily. I think I'll start doing that next turn.
