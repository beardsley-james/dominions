# Heading North

![Overview](/assets/images/jomon_07001.jpg)

Lots of units on my cap now, but only for a turn. I move all my armies over to my cavalry commander and set my infantry commander to patrol, just in case there's some giant spy hiding behind a building somewhere like a creeper.

I'm recruiting another cavalry commander and some horsemen to move up as reinforcements when I strike against the giant building the fort up there. If he is. I sent him a message in-game last turn so maybe he'll respond now and let me know what he's up to. If he moves off the space without building a fort I won't harass him but if he doesn't I'm going to kick him out.

I'm recruiting a small fishmen army here too. Even if I don't need them for anything specific, it seems like their nets could be pretty useful against a lot of enemies and I don't think a little squad of them is going to hurt anything, especially when I strike against the western lake to build another fort over there.

I'm keeping my sky skirting around in these northern territories so that I can see if he's bringing up reinforcements. Apparently he only has three units on that southernmost space so hopefully he's just chilling there for now but maybe it'd be good to take him out anyway. Stay tuned.
