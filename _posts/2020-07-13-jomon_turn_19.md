This turn is the point of no return, where I'm committing all my forces to this war and announcing myself as a serious threat to Phlegra. My spies are moving into position and I have eyes in his territory. Ninjas are mobilizing for dark deeds and I'm moving holy units around so that they can preach my dominion and keep my word strong. My poor ailing pretender is making his way up the western flank of my territory site searching while he can, and I'm frantically researching construction so that I can build a ring of regeneration for him and at least keep him alive until I figure out a more permanent cure. None of my contacts have the ability to craft it so I'm on my own.
