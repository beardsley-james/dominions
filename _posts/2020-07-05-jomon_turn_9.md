# A Bit of a Whimper

I thought he said he was building a fort in this province but no one was here except these three javelineers who immediately fled the battlefield for parts unknown. Did I just get into a war without having to?

I watch a battle with these guys in the province over the mountain range from the farmlands I just took. That's a big stack of giants. The javelins destroy the enemy forces before they can do significant damage, those heavy cav only took out one guy in the front row. I have a feeling they're coming from me and don't relish the possibility of having to face them on the field.

I got some mercenaries finally. A bunch of ranged support, for a couple turns at least, led by a troubador. I don't know what troubadors do in combat but it looks like the answer is not much since this guy doesn't have any special abilities and can't cast and isn't even a good commander. I wonder if I just got the joke prize merc squad.

I feel like I've got enough ranged guys out there that I don't have to build a lot more so I switch over to these heavy armored samurai. If anyone's going to be able to stand up to giants it'll be them. Still trying for that water shugenja I need if I'm going to make rings of breathing.

I split my forces in two so I can take neutral provinces. I expect that death ball of giants to start rolling towards me soon and I'll have to stop them but if I can harry his forces from behind I might be able to cripple his economy with raids. I set my spies to keep an eye on his army and also to head over to investigate that new friend that just showed up to the southeast. My infantry commander heads south to pick up some units to take that last province in my cap circle that I haven't grabbed yet because I was distracted by these giants. I'll have to see if I can broker some sort of peace agreement but I imagine he's pretty pissed.
