# Enemy at the Gates

![Sassy message](/assets/images/ulm_03001.jpg)

They did mention in the game description that you would be made fun of if you didn't rename your commander and here it is.

My first battle against independents. Lots of heavy cavalry in this province but I only lose a few units which seems pretty great. Those heavy cavalry are supposed to be scary but I guess ulmish infantry doesn't have to worry about it too much. The commander grabs a couple kills when he's in there too.

My spy oversees a battle in another province. It seems the phlegra pretender is a brute and is going around soloing independent provinces. Looks like a beefy combat chassis with a lot of astral power and some good resistances. He makes quick work of this pretty beefy province defense but I guess he bit off more than he can chew at some point because he's suffering from a permanent wound. Hopefully he doesn't keep moving north.

I'm going to try to scout out his cap with my spy. I keep my army close to my cap so that they can come up as reinforcements in case he does keep moving north. I'm recruiting another spy and another infantry commander to start a second expansion army. To the northwest is a terrifying throne army with like 400 demons, don't think I'm going to be moving there anytime soon.
