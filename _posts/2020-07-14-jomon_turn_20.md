# First Blood

![Announcements](/assets/images/jomon_20001.jpg)

I take all the territories I planned on taking with few losses. I don't know if he wasn't expecting the strike or just didn't know how to react, but a couple of the provinces he lost were in the process of constructing forts which is a tough blow. Utgard finally bites the big one and Caelum is moving in at the same time, taking a good chunk of Phlegran territory.

Caelum is going to assault Phlegra proper while I take the two provinces to the south. I move a good sized force into the forest to hit the units there, which I think otherwise will combine into a big doomball of soldiers in the city. The rest of my armies move south to take the fort there and I bring in my second Ryujin, in dragon form, set up to self-buff and then assault the rearmost enemies, hopefully cutting a costly battle short. Gath, the southern neighbor of the war, agrees to a temporary non-aggression pact for the duration of the conflict.
