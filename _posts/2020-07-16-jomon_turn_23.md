# Getting Ready to Ricochet

We take the barbarian army out easily and reclaim our territory. Our holdings in Phlegra seem secure.

Phlegra repels the sieging forces in Phlegra so I commit my armies to take it back. The siege in the southern fort is almost finished so I send them a few reinforcements to make sure we can take it while the bulk of my troops gets ready to take their capital. Tien Chi and Caelum are still dancing, I talk to Atlantis and we agree to stay out of each other's hair while I subtly suggest that he should take the fight to Caelum if he has the opportunity. Next turn I'll be able to make a ring of regeneration so Snakebite builds a lab in the western fort where he'll be able to put it on. I have to decide if I want to fight Abyssia or Caelum next, I'm leaning towards Abysia since my NAP-3 with Caelum remains in place, though I am considering rescinding it to make sure I'll be able to hit him when I have the opportunity. I'm recruiting Ryujin again my western army is almost ready to roll. One of my spies has almost circumnavigated the world and I'm looking forward to seeing him again. I think my prophet died at some point and I didn't notice, though. Snakebite is in bad shape.
