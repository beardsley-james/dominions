# Province Defense

Good thing I changed my orders since Doven gets attacked by a large force of giants. The defense hold them back long enough to take cannon fire from my mage while the Tengu warrior goes in solo and kills ten of the creatures single handed. They can hardly touch him and he kills them fast enough that he doesn't take another injury. We manage to kill their commander this time and there are no survivors on his side with only one permanent loss on mine, a glorious victory.

I move my armies into position to reject any claims he may make on my territories. I move reinforcements into Doven in case that stack of seventy soldiers pushes south, and his cap is under siege by my flying allies. I start building a temple in the lake and one of my samurai generals begins construction of a fort in the province next to the throne. The large expenditure means my recruitment is slowed down, though, so hopefully these are enough armies for a couple turns. I agree to send Tien-Chi earth gems in exchange for my cap circle so I won't have to fight those centaurs myself after all.
