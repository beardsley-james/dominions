This is more like it. My infantry wipes out a good sized mob of independents with only a single loss.

My next target has a lot of archers so I build some guys with shields and another forge priest.

I'm still working on filling out my cap circle. I decide to send my big troop ball south to try to take that barbarian province bordering enemy territory and send my other infantry commander back to the cap to pick up his own squad so he can take out the western province. Merpeople continue to swarm in the depths and still no sign of catsnake.
