# Early Days

These Pelagian troopers seem like a good deal for what they're packing so I order a bunch of them and another scout and a commander to lead them into my battle. This is going to be my second expansion army.

I send my first expansion army south to see if we can take that kelp forest for Papa Smurf and send my prophetized scout north to spread the word to the mermen there. Looks like pretty easy expansion prospects except for that province to the west, but I'll have to see how Pelagian troops do in battle and maybe read a guide or something. I get plenty of water gems from my cap structure so it's all about getting up to the right summoning level to bring water elementals online at this point.
