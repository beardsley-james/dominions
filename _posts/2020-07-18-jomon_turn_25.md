# All Kind of Stuff

This turn is crazy. Ragha and Ulm came on chat to say that they thought Man was going to run away with the game but it turns out he vultured some provinces from their war with Patala that they felt entitled to and it seems like they want everyone else to dogpile this guy even though it's way early in the game for that to happen. This was my orders at first since I was expecting aggression from Abysia, but I realized I have no way to roll over that doomstack they have set up next to me so instead I'm playing nice and moving guys around to try to deescelate that conflict before it can start so I can wait for Caelum to come in and support me in the war which would be necessary for me to be able to win. Phlegra is under siege and AI so they're pretty much out of the game, Gath hasn't agreed to terms but we had a nice conversation anyway, and Tien Chi is getting rocked. Agartha and Malignon are almost out and Tien Chi is getting pretty beat up but TC and Agartha have both said they're going to send me goodies before their respective enemies take them so I may be getting a lot of gems and items soon. I'm site searching everywhere to try and get nature gems online and I'm building a fort in my northwest province ostensibly to build shugenjas out of but also to set up for military purposes when it comes to blows with Abysia. Caelum accidentally takes one of my provinces when automated patrollers find one of his goblin blobs heading south for the war with Tien Chi but he's going to let me take it back he says. Next turn is going to be nerve wracking - Caelum may be betraying me, Abysia might use my retreat as an excuse to start rolling through my territory, or Gath may attack me since we don't have any kind of NAP at this point. I don't know if my forces in the south are enough to fight their way into their respective castles either so the whole thing is a weird gamble. Good times.
