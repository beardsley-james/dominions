# Never Mind, Definitely War

![Throne of Summer](/assets/images/jomon_11001.jpg)

That province I failed to take last turn? Utgard has no similar problems. This big stack of fighters clears out the province with only one loss and is now looming on my borders. With this and the other army coming into play I assume I'm now at war and begin to prepare for such. Too bad, I was hoping for a turn or two more of expansion but I guess Utgard lands are going to have to do.

This province is taken easily and all enemies are destroyed. Sohei are beasts.

This magic fish gem load means that I can forge that water breathing amulet I needed. Of course, now I have to fight a war so it's not quite that easy but at least there's a game plan after I fight off the Utgard menace.

These two big groups of giants have me real worried. The Utgard player hasn't been interacting with me at all so I don't know what his intentions are but I have to assume they're not peaceful and act as such because I don't want to be caught on a back foot in a war like this. Maybe I should have been more aggressive with raiding but I was hoping he would just let me have that farm province.

I'm moving two main forces up north to get ready to defend against or retaliate against the Utgard troops. I'm going to take empty provinces with spies and a ninja to give him something to respond to in his northern territories in case he moves against me and I'm finishing my second level fort in my pond. I only have the infantry commander in my cap and he doesn't have anyone to bless my Sohei so I leave them behind and move with just samurai and archers into the province to the north. Everything on the border has PD so he's not going to get any easy acquisitions from me. My cap is set to recruit more sohei and archers who are going to join up with the indy commanders that are moving into the cap and head up to reinforce with the new priest I'm summoning there. Snakebite is going to be able to start throwing lightning bolts around next turn as a caster if the Utgard are still around. I've contacted the Caerum player and he's going to be attacking as well, and Tien'chi to Utgard's north is in an NAP with me too and will also join in if need be. Hopefully the sheer number of threats drives the Utgard player to distraction and I can win this war without taking serious losses. Sharks are in production as well and should be able to join up with existing forces. All this upkeep isn't going to do me any good if I can't use it to expand my territory so this is going to be an important set of battles. We'll see how it goes.
