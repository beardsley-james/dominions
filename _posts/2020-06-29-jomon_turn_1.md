# First Turn

Everyone's waking up and getting ready to rumble. Let's see what I'm working with.

Here's what I'm working with. There's some farms nearby I should try to capture if I can and there's a couple of lakes close to me that I can dive into to try to set up my underwater fort. There's only a few water tiles around so hopefully I'm not fighting Atlantis for this, since I know they're in the game. I think they're on the other side of the map which means they won't be attacking my underwater tiles for awhile, if at all.

I'm going to pick up some cheap samurai and a master shugenja to act as my prophet. I don't just want to prophetize my starting commander because I feel like prophets should have robes and a beard, especially for as fabulous a dragon as Snakebite, so I'm going to wait until next turn to make a prophet.

I'm going to send my one ninja west to scout, he's nice and sneaky so he shouldn't be attracting to much attention while he's slinking around. I could blind expand but I'm feeling conservative this game so I'm going to hold my forces back and start striking out next turn to try to take some early territory. Everything I've read suggests that you should try to have 12 territories by the time turn 12 comes around so that's what I'm going for but we'll see if I can make it.
