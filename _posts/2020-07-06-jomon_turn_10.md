# A Bit of a Whimper

Someone grabbed a real early throne, good job Hillary, you won this one.

I dramatically underestimated the amount of martial force I needed to bring to bear on this independent province and I paid for it. These heavy cavalry swept away pretty much my entire army. Fortunately it was mostly mercenaries but the loss of my one monk guy stings. I'll need to summon another one so that I can build the temple I'll need to start fielding Ryujin. Fortunately I don't think Utgard can take it without heavy losses either, so it's providing a buffer space between our territories for now.

This other battle goes a lot better and we quickly rout the wolf tribe with blessed Soheis doing a lot of the leg work.

This worldwide heat wave should be bad for Utgard too, I think. Though I'm still not sure if we're at proper war or not.

A random Tengu shows up and wants to work for me. I'm pretty into this guy, he has a nasty magic sword and he has that one time use lightning spell that does a bunch of damage to an area. I'm probably going to want to use him to show the business end of a lightning bolt to Utgard if we come to blows again, though I think he needs to get kitted out better if he's going to last for very long against them. Lightning damage, though!

This giant army shows up outside of my new province. Friendly? They don't look friendly, but no one does in this game. I'll have to get in touch with them and see if this is something to worry about. That's like 170 troops which is considerably larger than any army I can currently field.

I still don't have a water shugenja but I find this in the list of items I can make. It costs 10 air gems so it'll be a couple turns until I can afford it but that should let me get that priest I need underwater. I'll have to move some shugenja out to start searching for magic sites, though, or I'm not going to be able to do much in terms of artifacts which is something I really feel like I should have.

I'm moving my expansion armies out again. There's no sign of that blob of giants I was expecting to trample through my lands so maybe he's just ceding this province to me for now. Snakebite is going to level up the fort underwater so that I can recruit more sharks but in the mean time they're creeping out of their lairs and getting ready to field a unit. The Tengu is going to help in the raid in the east because I want to see what he can do in battle and the infantry commander continues to move to the cap to pick up a second expansion army so we can spread out south. I'm not quite where I need to be in terms of expansion this game but I think I can speed it up a bit once I get two armies and hopefully get up to twelve provinces by turn 13 or so.
