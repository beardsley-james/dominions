We easily take the province from the local defense.

We easily hold the province when Agartha tries to take it, too.

His lines draw up to mine but his weak soldiers are nothing compared to the might of Ulmish steel and they wither before my attacks.

I'm moving a mason in to build a fort in the north and my forces consolidate my hold on the territory up there. I may push into Agarthan holdings since he has so few armies mobile in that area. My southern expeditionary force continues to be equipped and I place a bid for mercenaries so that I can use them as fodder when I take that province full of cavalry. My spies continue to skirt around looking for someplace to press my advantage while my priest smiths ply their trade in pursuit of lead shot to fling at our enemies.
