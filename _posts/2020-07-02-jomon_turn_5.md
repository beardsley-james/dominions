# Spreading Out and First Contact

Snakebite makes quick work of this merman leader and the rest of his tribe flees to the hills so Snakebite can build a sand castle.

These giants get into a wrestling match with some independent forces only two spaces away from my cap - not a good time. They get beat up pretty bad though and hopefully don't feel confident enough to start a war immediately. I put some PD in the next province south from them anyway, though.

This is where the archers start charging forward to beat fishmen to death with their bows. This is also right before I realized I had selected attack instead of fire on their orders page. Good job, but don't do it again, samurai archers. If they don't get this many kills in the next battle maybe I'll keep using them as melee troops though.

![Still the best k/d ratio](/assets/images/jomon_05006.jpg)

Like step it up Samurai. You should be able to kill more fish people with your swords than they can kill with their razor bows. That master shugenja is pulling some weight, though.

![Get me some elephants](/assets/images/jomon_05007.jpg)

I don't know why I want this squad of elephants so much but I do. I'm going to send them after the giants next turn if he doesn't message me back.

I'm sending a message to the giants, hopefully they agree to play nice and give my that space they're on which is way too close to my cap. Then again, maybe their cap is directly north and I'll find it with my ninja next turn. That would be a bit uncomfortable. Snakebite is going to chill in that lake and build a fortress so I can start sending some sharks to bite their faces off if he isn't playing ball and my conquest troops are going to head south to clear out another space around my cap. I'm building another master shugenja and more sacred troops and archers in the cap so they'll be able to swing through for reinforcements if we end up having to go smack some giants around before my sharks are ready.
