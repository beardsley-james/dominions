My defenders in that province I took from Pythia repel an attack from invading hydras, but it's a costly victory and I lose most of my infantry in the process. I dump a few points into PD there and hope they can hold out long enough for it to matter. My army in the northwest is ready to roll and heads out to slaughter those druids while we have the chance and a second army is almost ready to head out from Ulm proper. It's going to head east and then join up with the northwest army to smash that last province with all the guys in it and then roll into the Pythian territory there and meet up with that other army to keep heading towards the Pythian capital if that fort doesn't get stormed first. I'm going to send a couple forge priests with it to cast iron shot and hopefully do a lot of damage with that. Those hydras are something to keep an eye out for since their poison damage chews through my melee troops. Agartha to the north doesn't seem to be pushing forward at this point so hopefully they just think that was a regular bump because I'm in a hot war with Pythia now. I think Phlegra might be getting ready to join in with all those troops south of me.
