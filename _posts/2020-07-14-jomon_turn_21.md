# Barbarian Invasion

![Announcements](/assets/images/jomon_21001.jpg)

Someone took the throne of war so crazy barbarian incursion pop up all over my territory. I take the woods and the city that I was planning on hitting but lose a province to barbarian attackers and my Ryujin factory is under siege now.

The battle in the forest is a decisive victory. I think this province held the bulk of his built up heavy cavalry which he lost sixty percent of in the battle, a serious economic blow for the beleaguered army. I lost a lot of chaff and, unfortunately, the heroic tengu that had proven so decisive in my war against Utgard, but he lost significantly more and for the most part his means to reinforce the army. He must have been holding the army stationary to counterstrike invading forces in Phlegra. This was the first real battle where my shugenjas came in as artillery and I think they did more damage than is reflected in their kill county, certainly more than the massed archers though that may only be because they stayed out of melee with all the chaff in front of them.

Barbarians invade the city province after I defeat the Phlegran forces but they aren't able to withstand the assault of my army and wither back into the countryside.

Agartha has requested my assistance in their war against Abysia and I'm massing forces to do so after taking the throne. My assault Ryujin ran away from the fighting so I send him to help repel the independent force sieging my lake. I move a larger army into the forest in case he tries to strike south and so that I can regain the plains province nearby from the one hundred barbarians that showed up out of nowhere. Gath has taking a piece for himself and Caelum is doing well, though his birds seem to fare poorly in protracted battles if they can't take out the commanders in the first few turns - good for me, since I plan on betraying him at some point. Caelum at this point has begun to attack Tien Chi, so that may come sooner than later.
