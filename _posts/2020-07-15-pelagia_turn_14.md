# My Lake

I'm moving to take the last province in my chosen expansion territory this turn. With no other neutral territories around I'm going to have to start a war soon - Agartha is my first target, I think, with EA R'Lyeh after them since they seem pretty weak. I have sizable armies moving around with no one to fight so that's going to be a high priority. I'm moving reinforcements to the southwest to get ready for my war and picking up neutrals on the way. My research is clipping around - Papa Smurf is a good researcher and he makes everyone else on the same space as him a better researcher as well. MA R'Lyeh seems content with the territory he's working on and hasn't poked at my defenses at all. I'm making a lot of money and I'm going to have three forts soon so that's good.
