# Nasty Losses

My northern expansion army, feeling good after their two part victory last turn, race face first into death in the shape of a communion of druids. They could fight the basic units but Ulmish magic defense is lacking and they get put to sleep and butchered, making my northern territory much more tenuous.

Fortunately it doesn't seem that my northern neighbor is getting ready to strike. I move a master mason north to start building a fort on the border and send my new expansion army south to join up with the mercenary forces and prepare to sweep west and north. In five months they should get to the northern border where they'll be able to press our claim to the Agarthan cap circle. He may think that we just bumped in which case he won't worry about it too much and won't see my coming. I'm preparing another army to head north and join up with the survivors of the battle to take that territory and keep preaching to spread my dominion.
