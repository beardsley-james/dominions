# Expansion Dance

I take losses in the south and decide to park here to build a fort. I'm clearing up the space in the eastern side of my sea but it looks like someone decided to dip their toe in. We have a discussion and I agree to let him hold the province an extra turn to pay for the mercenary company he paid to take it with. We agree to a joint attack on Agartha.
