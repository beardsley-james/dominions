# Pretender Design

![Jack Black](/assets/images/ulm_00000.jpg)

MA Ulm seems pretty straightforward even though reading about it I don't think this is actually a good pretender design. It's got a lot of blesses but I don't think there are actually any good sacred troops in Ulm so this isn't actually very useful and also I gave it magic scales but it seems like best practice to go drain instead - oh well, hopefully my chunky infantry can carry me. This is a dormant pretender too, for extra points, we'll see if I can live long enough for him to make an appearance. I did get to name my prophet Kyle Gass, though, which I think is a pretty slick move.
