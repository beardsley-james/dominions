# A New Hero

![Xi Akloz the Pearlsmith](/assets/images/pelagia_13001.jpg)

A heroic unit joins my armies, a powerful water and astral mage with holy two and the ability to create pearls from water gems. He also has research 22 so he's going to help me research for now so that I can get water elementals online as soon as possible.

I'm patrolling in the northwest to hold off a turn before I take that province back, which he's emptied per my instructions. I move onto the throne space. My prophet is with them so I'll be able to claim it right away. It looks like Agartha is taking that throne before I can but I plan on taking it back.
