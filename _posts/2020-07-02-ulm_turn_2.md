# Heading Out

I'm picking up a few more big axe bois and another smith priest this turn, probably going to be my queue for awhile but here it is again.

I put in a bid for this unit of merceneries. I'm not too worried about actually getting them so I just go for the minimum but maybe they'll want to fight for me, who knows.

My scouts report that I'm surrounded by beefy and kind of intimidating indie armies, including a 100 strong group of humans and a bunch of barbarians. I send my guys northwest to start with, since that seems like the squishiest target, but when I get more guys I can go after the rest of them. I know Ulm is supposed to be notoriously tough in melee but I still feel like I should have more than my minimal starting forces to claim most of these provinces. I send my spy ranging south - those two farm tiles to the east of me look really tempting and it seems like a good place for a second fort so that's my medium-term target for expansion.
