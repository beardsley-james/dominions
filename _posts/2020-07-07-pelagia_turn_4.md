# Baby Steps

I send my second expansion army west to take that mermen province while my first expansion army moves back to the cap to pick up reinforcements. I remember that I had the first expansion army patrol because I wanted to use the soldiers in the cap to reinforce the second army. They'll be heading north after they pick up more guys. Still researching summoning and stockpiling water gems.
