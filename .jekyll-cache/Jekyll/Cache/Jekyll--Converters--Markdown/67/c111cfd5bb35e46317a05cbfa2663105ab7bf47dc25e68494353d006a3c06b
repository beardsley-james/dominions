<p>Iâ€™m going with a dragon chassis on this one because it seems fun. I did a little single player testing with this pretender before the game started and it seems like heâ€™s a pretty good thug that can dive at the back line and tear them up while the main body of independent armies is scrambling to chase him around. Iâ€™m going with an air bless so that I can use air shield to hopefully keep the bulk of arrows off my squishy sacred troops even though Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll continue to have problems with ranged attackers. I didnâ€™t do this in testing but it might be a good idea to have some units of cavalry ready to scramble around the periphery of battles to jump in and attack anyone shooting into my combats.</p>

<p>Reading up it seems like Jomon has a lot of problems. No shields, medium casters, so this could be a tough fight. Their shark dudes seem really cool though so my plan is to beeline it underwater as fast as I can so that I can start throwing armies of shark guys at my enemies.</p>
