<p>Everyone else is apparently fine with prophetizing their first leader and I start with a list of all the other factions in the game. Oh well, slow to the draw I guess.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jomon_02002.jpg" alt="40 enemy units in the east territory" /></p>

<p>These guys to the east of me seem like the squishiest target. Everyone around my space seems a little tough for my starter army to properly take on so Iâ€™m going to hold back my infantry forces and send out my dragon by himself to see if he can snipe the leaders and rout this independent army to get closer to the lake.</p>

<p>This guy is going to be my prophet. Heâ€™s got two fire, too, so he can throw some fireballs at dudes while heâ€™s in battle spreading my dominion. Heâ€™s going to travel with the main infantry army to start with and probably start looking for some good magic sites when I have the territory to look in.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m researching up to construction 2 so that I can start making rings of water so I can send a holy unit underwater to build a temple so I can build these bad ass dragon mages that you can only build underwater. I donâ€™t actually have anyone researching at this point but I will soon, hopefully, since I need to keep spawning mages until I get someone with the water magic I need to be able to build them and also find some water gems. Itâ€™s a shaky plan but I can also just build crab commanders with shark armies until I get the temple up and running so I think itâ€™s still good.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s this weird space full of fish dudes near me. I donâ€™t want to fight them because they look muscly so Iâ€™m kind of holding back from that territory for now until I get a better idea of what to bring against them.</p>

<p>I looked them up online but I honestly donâ€™t know enough about the game yet to know whether or not I can take these guys. Iâ€™ll have to dig a little deeper and figure out what I need to throw at them. It looks like they have nets.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jomon_02008.jpg" alt="Atlantis???" /></p>

<p>I think this is where the underwater kingdom is. Itâ€™s on the other side of the world which is right where I want them, since scary underwater armies will put a real damper on my crab army plan and Iâ€™d rather they just stay over there. I canâ€™t imagine them wandering halfway across the planet to stop me at this point so I think I might be in the clear. I guess weâ€™ll see.</p>
