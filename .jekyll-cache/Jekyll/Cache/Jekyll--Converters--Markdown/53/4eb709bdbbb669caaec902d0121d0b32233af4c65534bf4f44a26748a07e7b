<p>Everyoneâ€™s waking up and getting ready to rumble. Letâ€™s see what Iâ€™m working with.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jomon_01003.jpg" alt="World map" /></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m working with. Thereâ€™s some farms nearby I should try to capture if I can and thereâ€™s a couple of lakes close to me that I can dive into to try to set up my underwater fort. Thereâ€™s only a few water tiles around so hopefully Iâ€™m not fighting Atlantis for this, since I know theyâ€™re in the game. I think theyâ€™re on the other side of the map which means they wonâ€™t be attacking my underwater tiles for awhile, if at all.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to pick up some cheap samurai and a master shugenja to act as my prophet. I donâ€™t just want to prophetize my starting commander because I feel like prophets should have robes and a beard, especially for as fabulous a dragon as Snakebite, so Iâ€™m going to wait until next turn to make a prophet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to send my one ninja west to scout, heâ€™s nice and sneaky so he shouldnâ€™t be attracting to much attention while heâ€™s slinking around. I could blind expand but Iâ€™m feeling conservative this game so Iâ€™m going to hold my forces back and start striking out next turn to try to take some early territory. Everything Iâ€™ve read suggests that you should try to have 12 territories by the time turn 12 comes around so thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going for but weâ€™ll see if I can make it.</p>
