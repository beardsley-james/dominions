<p>A battle happened! The report says I lost, though, and my dragon only killed three people but almost their whole army died.</p>

<p>He moved in and flew at their back line but the archers were staggered back a little bit so he didn’t engage them directly. He managed to breathe poison over their whole army and killed a ton of them.</p>

<p>They managed to take Snakebite down and give him a permanent injury in exchange for most of their army. God damn archers.</p>

<p>They gave him this. Looks like his combat speed is way slowed and his attack and defense are reduced a bit too. This is a real bummer and really hurts his utility as a thug. I think he can take this province next turn but I don’t know if he’s going to be able to clear an underwater tile on his own with such slow attacks. I’m sending him in again to see how he does.</p>

<p>Wandering Hobo starts his new job as the prophet of Snakebite, he’s going to go with the army to convert our enemies that don’t fall to our arrows and swords.</p>

<p>I’m going to start popping shugenjas to use as researchers and magic site hunters, hopefully I’ll get one with the water skill necessary to send a priest underwater but it’s really up to luck since they don’t have any guaranteed schools of study.</p>

<p>I’m sending an infantry army north to clear that pretty weedy looking independent army. My ninja is still scouting and Snakebite is going to move in to try to take that weakened province that repelled him so disgracefully last turn.</p>
